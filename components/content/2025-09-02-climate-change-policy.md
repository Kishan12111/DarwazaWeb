# Climate Change Policy: India's Path to Net Zero by 2070

India's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 represents one of the most ambitious climate targets set by any developing nation. This **governance** challenge requires unprecedented coordination across sectors and levels of government.

## National Climate Commitments

### Panchamrit Strategy
At COP26, India announced five key commitments:
1. 500 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030
2. 50% electricity from renewable sources by 2030
3. Reduction of carbon intensity by 45% by 2030
4. Reduction of 1 billion tonnes of CO2 by 2030
5. Net-zero emissions by 2070

### Policy Framework
The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) provides the **executive** framework for climate action through eight national missions covering solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, water, Himalayan ecosystems, green India, sustainable agriculture, and strategic knowledge.

## Renewable Energy Revolution

India's renewable energy sector has witnessed remarkable growth:
- Solar capacity increased from 2.6 GW in 2014 to over 70 GW in 2024
- Wind energy capacity exceeds 87 GW
- Total renewable capacity surpassed 180 GW

The **transparency** in renewable energy auctions has attracted global investments, making India one of the most attractive renewable energy markets worldwide.

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Economic Transition
The shift to clean energy requires massive investments estimated at $10.1 trillion by 2070. This transition presents both challenges and opportunities:
- Job creation in renewable energy sectors
- Potential job losses in coal-dependent regions
- Need for reskilling and upskilling programs

### Technological Innovation
India's approach emphasizes indigenous technology development:
- National Solar Mission promoting domestic manufacturing
- Green hydrogen mission targeting 5 MMT production by 2030
- Electric vehicle adoption with supporting infrastructure

## Role of States and Local Governments

**Federalism** plays a crucial role in climate action implementation:
- State-specific renewable energy policies
- Urban climate action plans
- Local adaptation strategies for vulnerable communities

## International Cooperation

India's climate diplomacy focuses on:
- Common but Differentiated Responsibilities principle
- Technology transfer and climate finance
- South-South cooperation initiatives
- International Solar Alliance leadership

## Sectoral Strategies

### Agriculture
Climate-smart agriculture practices include:
- Drought-resistant crop varieties
- Precision farming techniques
- Sustainable water management
- Organic farming promotion

### Industry
Industrial decarbonization through:
- Energy efficiency improvements
- Process optimization
- Circular economy principles
- Green financing mechanisms

## Monitoring and **Accountability**

The government has established robust monitoring systems:
- National GHG inventory updates
- State-level climate action monitoring
- Corporate sustainability reporting mandates
- Public disclosure of environmental data

## Conclusion

India's journey toward net-zero emissions by 2070 requires transformative changes across all sectors of the economy. Success depends on effective coordination between the **legislature**, **executive**, and **judiciary**, along with active participation from states, businesses, and civil society.

The path ahead demands innovative financing mechanisms, technological breakthroughs, and strong political will. While challenges are significant, India's commitment to climate action positions it as a global leader in sustainable development, demonstrating that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand.
